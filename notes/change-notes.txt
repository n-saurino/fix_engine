Changes:
- Refactored the Memory Pool to incorporate the paradigm's used in Charles Frasch's SPSC Queue
- Templated the Memory Pool and added a compile-time capacity so that the free list can be a stack-allocated array
- Reworked the helper functions to reflect a stack-style free list instead of the array I had before that dealt with fragmentation

Next Steps:
- Make sure I add thread-local support for memory pool
- Integrate a LFQueue for passing FIX message buffer pointers from application's thread-local memory pool to TX Network Handler thread.
- Integrate a LFQueue for returning the FIX message buffer pointers from the TX Network Handler thread that need to be deallocated in the application thread's thread-local memory pool

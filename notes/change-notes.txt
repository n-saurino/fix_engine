Changes:
- Updated the testing framework for the new templated MemoryPool
- MemoryPool passed full suite of tests.

Next Steps:
- Look at options for FIXBuffer buffer pointer. Right now, it is a char* but that creates issues when I need to pass a char* back from FIXBuffer to MemoryPool.Free(). I think this may get taken care of when I refactor my FIXMessage Framework. 
- Make sure I add thread-local support for memory pool
- Integrate a LFQueue for passing FIX message buffer pointers from application's thread-local memory pool to TX Network Handler thread.
- Integrate a LFQueue for returning the FIX message buffer pointers from the TX Network Handler thread that need to be deallocated in the application thread's thread-local memory pool

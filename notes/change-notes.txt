Changes:
- Refactored Benchmarking Framework to support new Benchmarks by introducing a formatter class and using the same derived BenchmarkLogger that inherits from the benchmark::BenchmarkReporter class
- Had to break out separate main functions and executables for each benchmark Fixture
- Removed filtering on prometheus metrics
- Added Benchmarks for the LFQueue
- Added Tests for the LFQueue
- Corrected an issue with the docker Network so that the client and server could connect

Next Steps:
- Add LFQueue Benchmark visualization to Grafana
- Integrate LFQueue in application
- Refactor Memory Pool and make it thread local
- Integrate Messages with LFQueue for fast communication between threads running the application and the network managers

Changes:
* Set up benchmarking pipeline by running Prometheus and its node_exporter as microservices.
* Exposing the data from Prometheus to Grafana cloud for visualization
* Created a basic dashboard in Grafana displaying the FIX message encoder latency metrics
* Choosing to run benchmark scripts on commits using locally to avoid inconsistencies from running benchmarks through Github Actions based on their server load
* Added separate logs for csv files (internal use) and for prometheus files (external visualization)
* Created a script folder to organize the scripts related to the project

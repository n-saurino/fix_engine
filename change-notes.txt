Changes:
* Removed old files from compile_commands.json
* Created a struct for CompIds and account name for quick lookup in FIXMessage construction along the hotpath
* added a trailing null character to the buffers in Order in case the char buffers passed in are longer than the member variable buffer size
* Updated the sequence number generator to an atomic so that it is thread safe for the future
* Fixed version and gtest conflicts between the test build and the application build

Next:
* Refactor Append functions to optimize tag handling
* Explore FIXBuffer optimizations by using free functions and direct raw buffer access
* Create a memory pool for the FIXBuffers
* Create a lock-free queue for the FIXMessages
* Create a message parser to parse messages received from the FIX Server

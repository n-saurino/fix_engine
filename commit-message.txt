chore(eod): Checkpointing work for continuation on alternate setup

Pushing current progress to ensure continuity across development environments. This is not a feature completion or functional checkpoint but a working snapshot to resume from another setup if needed.

Changes:
- Ongoing development; see commit history for incremental updates.

Next steps:
- Continue implementation and validation from current state.
- Resume work on pending items outlined in previous commits.

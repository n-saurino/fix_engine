fix(network): Improve error handling and buffer safety in socket operations

Added basic error catching for `send()` and `recv()` to improve robustness in network communication. Fixed a buffer overflow issue in `recv()` within the Network Profiler, enhancing reliability and stability in benchmarking.

Changes:
- Implemented basic error handling for `send()` and `recv()` to prevent failures from propagating.
- Fixed buffer overflow correction in `recv()` in the Network Profiler.

Next steps:
- Implement basic FIX SBE message transmission between the Engine and test server within the next 24 hours.
- Continue refining exception handling in the socket programming module.
- Implement a performance logging system to track optimization improvements.
- Further optimize message handling for performance and reliability.
- Investigate and fix rare occurrences of negative minimum latencies in latency benchmarking.

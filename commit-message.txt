feat(concurrency): Implement basic framework for SPSC lock-free queue

Completed an initial pass through Charles Frasch's implementation of a single-producer, single-consumer (SPSC) lock-free queue. Established the foundational class framework for `LFQueue`, outlining its core structure in preparation for implementing enqueue and dequeue operations.

Changes:
- Finished reviewing Charles Frasch's SPSC lock-free queue implementation.
- Created the initial `LFQueue` class structure with key member variables and type definitions.
- Established a foundation for efficient inter-thread message passing.

Next steps:
- Integrate `LFQueue` into the messaging pipeline for application-to-networking communication.
- Add unit tests to validate correctness and concurrency behavior.
- Benchmark performance to identify potential optimizations.

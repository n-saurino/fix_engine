refactor(logging): Introduce Formatter class for flexible benchmark logging

Refactored the `BenchmarkLogger` by introducing a `Formatter` class inheritance structure, enabling custom formatting for different benchmarks as needed. The logger now accepts a formatter that delegates logging logic to derived class implementations, simplifying the `BenchmarkLogger` and improving modularity.

Changes:
- Introduced a `Formatter` class hierarchy to allow custom benchmark log formatting.
- Updated `BenchmarkLogger` to accept a formatter that calls derived class `Log` functions.
- Simplified `BenchmarkLogger` by moving formatting logic into dedicated formatter classes.

Next steps:
- Validate the refactor by running FIXMessageBuilder benchmarks.
- Implement benchmarking for `LFQueue` performance.
- Develop unit tests to validate `LFQueue` functionality.

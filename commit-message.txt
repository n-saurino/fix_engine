chore(work-in-progress): End of day push for continuation from another setup

Pushing the latest changes to ensure work can continue from another machine if needed. This is not a finalized checkpoint, but a work-in-progress commit to preserve current progress.

Changes:
- Latest in-progress modifications and ongoing development work.

Next steps:
- Refactor `Append` functions to improve tag handling performance.
- Optimize `FIXBuffer` by leveraging free functions and direct raw buffer access.
- Implement a memory pool for `FIXBuffer` to reduce dynamic allocations.
- Design a lock-free queue for efficient message processing.
- Build a high-performance FIX message parser to handle inbound server messages.

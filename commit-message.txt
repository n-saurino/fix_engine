chore(work-in-progress): End of day push for continuation from another setup

Pushing the latest changes to ensure work can continue from another machine if needed. This is not a finalized checkpoint, but a work-in-progress commit to preserve current progress.

Changes:
- Latest in-progress modifications and ongoing development work.

Next steps:
- Implement validation checks to prevent malformed messages and buffer overflows.
- Develop a memory pool for `FIXBuffer` objects to improve memory efficiency.
- Complete implementations for remaining core FIX messages (Heartbeat, Logout, etc.).
- Build the FIX Message Parser for structured message interpretation.
- Optimize FIX message construction using `memcpy` and formatting tricks for performance gains.
